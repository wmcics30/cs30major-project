# Proposal
For my major project, I will be making a standard Sudoku game. The player will have to fill in the numbers 1-9 once in every row, column, and 3x3 square. The code itself will able to solve any empty Sudoku level first so that it can save the answer. 

## Needs To Have
- An interactive grid
- Have the user input numbers that will display on said grid
- Be able to check if the user has made a mistake
- Be able to check if the user has completed the game
- A recursive algorithm that will be able to solve any Sudoku level and save the answer
- Multiple difficulty levels

## Nice To Have
- Have both the option to type numbers in using the keyboard or be able to click on a number row on the bottom and place them using the mouse
- Allow people to keep track of possible numbers before committing to it
- Sound effects
- Background music

## Taking it to the Next Level
- Be able to randomly generate new levels every time and then solve them
