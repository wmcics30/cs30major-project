# Proposal
For my major project, I will be making a web-based Sudoku game

## Needs To Have
- An interactive grid
- Have the user input numbers that will display on said grid
- Be able to check if the user has made a mistake
- Be able to check if the user has completed the game
- Sound effects
- Background music
- A recursive algorithm that will be able to solve any Sudoku level and save the answer

## Nice To Have
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Be able to randomly generate new levels every time and then solve them
- Have both the option to type numbers in using the keyboard or be able to click on a number row on the bottom and place them using the mouse
